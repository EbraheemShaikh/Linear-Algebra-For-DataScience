    "1. Start with the square of the length:
",
    "   \\\\[ \\\\|\\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|^2 = \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} + 2\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\]\
2. Replace dot products with lengths:
",
    "   \\\\[ = \\\\|\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\|^2 + 2(\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}) + \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|^2 \\\\]\
3. Apply Cauchy-Schwarz:
",
    "   \\\\[ \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\leq \\\\|\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\| \\\\]\
4. Therefore:
",
    "   \\\\[ \\\\|\\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|^2 \\\\leq \\\\|\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\|^2 + 2\\\\|\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\|\\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\| + \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|^2 \\\\]\
5. Which simplifies to:
",
    "   \\\\[ \\\\|\\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|^2 \\\\leq (\\\\|\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\| + \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|)^2 \\\\]\
6. Taking square roots:
