# 📈 Progress Log: Linear Algebra for Data Science

### 📅 June 30, 2025
- ✅ Completed Khan Academy: Lesson 4 – Basis of a Subspace (Lecture 2)
- 🧠 Learned:
  - A **basis** is a set of linearly independent vectors that spans a subspace
  - Every vector in the subspace has a **unique** representation using the basis
  - Subspaces can have **multiple bases**, including the standard basis
- 🧮 Example:
  - Verified that {[2, 3], [7, 0]} forms a basis of ℝ²
  - Compared it with the standard basis {[1, 0], [0, 1]}
- 📓 Created and uploaded notebook: `05_basis_of_subspace.ipynb`


### 📅 June 28, 2025
- ✅ Completed Khan Academy: Lesson 4 – Linear Subspaces (Lecture 1)
- 🧠 Learned:
  - Three essential conditions for a subspace:
    1. Contains zero vector
    2. Closed under scalar multiplication
    3. Closed under vector addition
  - Tested subspace conditions through examples:
    - Zero vector subspace in ℝ³ ✅
    - Non-subspace due to scalar violation ❌
    - Subspace formed by Span{v₁, v₂, v₃} ✅
- 📓 Created and uploaded notebook: `04_subspaces.ipynb`
  - Includes well-explained markdown and NumPy examples


### 📅 June 27, 2025
- ✅ Completed Khan Academy: Lesson 3 – Linear Independence (Lectures 2 & 3)
- 🧠 Learned:
  - Formal test for linear dependence using vector equations
  - How to solve a * v₁ + b * v₂ + ... = 0 to determine if a set is dependent or independent
  - Span of a 3D vector set and its relation to linear independence
- 📓 Created and uploaded: `03_linear_independence_examples.ipynb`
  - Includes 2D and 3D examples with NumPy and vector visualizations

### 📅 June 26, 2025
- ✅ Watched Khan Academy:
  - Lesson 2: Linear Combinations and Span
  - Lesson 3 (Lecture 1): Introduction to Linear Independence
- 📓 Created and uploaded notebook: `02_linear_combinations_span_independence.ipynb`
  - Explained span and independence with code examples and visualizations using NumPy and Matplotlib
- 🧠 Concepts covered:
  - Linear combinations
  - Span with formal set definition
  - Linear dependence and redundancy
  - Linear independence intuition and detection


## 📅 June 12, 2025

### 🧠 Khan Academy - Linear Algebra
- ✅ Completed **Lesson 1: Vectors and Spaces**
  - Topics covered:
    - What is a vector (magnitude & direction)
    - Real coordinate space and n-dimensional tuples
    - Vector addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication with visual intuition
    - Introduction to unit vectors and the concepts of **i** and **j**
    - Parametric representation of lines and position vectors
  - Completed 3 small assessments to reinforce understanding
  - Took handwritten notes to clarify difficult concepts (especially parametric lines)

### 💻 Python Practice
- ✅ Created a well-structured Google Colab notebook: `01_vectors_and_geometry.ipynb`
  - Summarized all key concepts from Lesson 1 in markdown
  - Added NumPy code examples for:
    - Vector addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication
  - Uploaded to GitHub:
    - 📁 Repository: [Linear-Algebra-For-DataScience](https://github.com/EbraheemShaikh/Linear-Algebra-For-DataScience)
    - 📄 Notebook: [`01_vectors_and_geometry.ipynb`](https://github.com/EbraheemShaikh/Linear-Algebra-For-DataScience/blob/main/01_vectors_and_geometry.ipynb)

### 📌 Plan Ahead
